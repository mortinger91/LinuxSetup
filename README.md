# LinuxSetup
Setup of a freshly installed Linux system, how I like it.  
After the first install, the config can be easily updated.  
This helps if you want to keep multiple machines in sync with the same config.  
Supports Debian-like systems.

How to configure the project for the first time:

1 - choose a folder: `~/dev`  
2 - `mkdir -p ~/dev && cd ~/dev`  
3 - `git clone https://github.com/mortinger91/LinuxSetup.git`  
4 - `~/dev/LinuxSetup/init-config.sh`

How to update your local config to the latest changes:

1 - `update-config`
